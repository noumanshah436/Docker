steps to follow:
1) copy Dockerfile from "06-building-container-images/api-node" to "05-example-web-application/api-node"
2) cd "05-example-web-application/api-node"
3) and build the image using that docker-file

-> Build docker file in the current directory:
$ docker build .

-> Also add a tag to that image
$ docker build -t api-node:0 .

List all images:
$ docker image ls



WORKDIR:
Set the working directory for any subsequent ADD, COPY, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, or RUN instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
