docker build commad syntax:

docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> -f <DOCKERFILE_PATH> <BUILD_CONTEXT>

<IMAGE_NAME>: The desired name and optionally a tag for the Docker image.

<DOCKERFILE_PATH>: The path to the Dockerfile you want to use. You can specify an absolute path or a relative path from the current directory.

<BUILD_CONTEXT>: The path to the directory containing the build context and related files.


Example:

Suppose you have a Dockerfile with a custom name, such as "Dockerfile.example," and you want to build an image using this Dockerfile:

docker build -t my-image -f Dockerfile.example .

In this example:

1) -t my-image specifies the name and optionally a tag for the Docker image as "my-image."

2) -f Dockerfile.example tells Docker to use the "Dockerfile.example" as the Dockerfile for the build.

3) . specifies the build context, which is the current directory. The Dockerfile and other necessary files referenced in the Dockerfile should be present in this context.


Using the -f option is particularly useful when you have multiple Dockerfiles in a project,
 and you want to select a specific one for a particular image build.
